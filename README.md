# Healthcare-Assistant-Chatbot-Project
This project is an AI-powered healthcare assistant chatbot built using Streamlit, Hugging Face Transformers, and NLTK. It provides users with basic healthcare-related responses, helping them with general queries about symptoms, medications, and doctor appointments.

Key Features:
AI-Powered Conversations: Uses a pre-trained DistilGPT-2 model for text generation.
Rule-Based Responses: Provides predefined answers for common healthcare-related keywords like "symptom," "medication," and "appointment."
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit, featuring a dark theme UI for an engaging chat experience.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Uses NLTK for tokenization and stopword handling.
Interactive Chat System: Users can input queries and receive instant responses from the chatbot.
Technology Stack:
Streamlit â€“ For creating an interactive web-based UI.
Hugging Face Transformers â€“ For AI-driven text generation using DistilGPT-2.
NLTK â€“ For basic text preprocessing.
This chatbot serves as an AI-powered virtual assistant for basic healthcare guidance, though it does not replace professional medical advice. ðŸš€
